Jupyter Widgets interface for browsing Wikidata knowledge graphs.

These notebooks help demonstrate how to bring up Wikidata Query
knowledge graphs without needing to know anything about the SPARQL
language. By selecting items from a list, you can generate knowledge
graphs showing depicted content from arists in particular collections.

You can test these out as well by using the Wikimedia PAWS system,
which is a Jupyter deployment for anyone with a Wikimedia/Wikipedia
account. Link: https://paws.wmcloud.org/
